# Capture and Convert
A WordPress Plugin to Help Increase Social Shares, Followers and Email Subscribers

## Features
 - Pick from 5 "widgets" geared towards growing your traffic, social media accounts or email submissions.
 - **Widget 1 - Share to Unlock widget.** Grow your traffic on social media by "locking" a piece of your site in exchange for a share on Twitter or Facebook.
 - **Widget 2 - Follow to Unlock widget.** Grow your following on Instagram, YouTube and Twitter by "locking" a piece of your site in exchange for a follow on social media.
 - **Widget 3 - Email to Unlock widget.** Grow your email list by "locking" a piece of value (i.e. webinar, ebook, checklist, etc) in exchange for a visitor's email address.
 - **Widget 4 - Call to Action widget.** Insert this widget within your blog posts to push traffic to a different part of your website. Want to promote a case study? New webinar? Don't annoy people with pop ups, simply use this widget to capture attention and push it to another page on your site.
 - **Widget 5 - Floating widget.** Stop using annoying pop ups to capture emails. This widget sits in the corner of your pages, always in view of visitors but never annoying them.
 - Select a pre designed template or build one from scratch. Match your website's fonts, colors and images to build seamless experiences.
 - Our widgets run on shortcodes that you simply drop into your pages or blog posts. This allows you to create custom (or multiple) offers across your website. Our widgets are fully compatible with Gutenberg and look amazing on mobile devices.
